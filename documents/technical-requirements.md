# Technical Requirements

## Target Architecture

### Desktop Application Specifications

**Application Type**: Packaged executable with external data files
- **Executable**: Double-click to launch (no Node.js required for end users)
- **Data Files**: External JSON files visible for easy sharing/copying
- **Architecture**: Option C - Packaged app that reads/writes external JSON files

**Key Benefits**:
- Users don't need Node.js installed
- JSON files remain visible for configuration sharing
- Professional desktop application experience
- Direct file system access for reliable data handling

## Platform Requirements

**Primary Platform**: Windows
- **Must work**: Windows (primary requirement)
- **Nice to have**: Mac/Linux compatibility if achievable
- **Focus**: Optimize for Windows, cross-platform is bonus

**Technology Recommendations**:
- **Electron**: Cross-platform by default, well-suited for web-based UI
- **Tauri**: Rust-based alternative, smaller footprint
- **Other**: Open to alternatives that meet requirements

## File System Access Requirements

### Direct File Operations
- **Read**: Application must read JSON files directly from file system
- **Write**: Application must write changes back to JSON files
- **Location**: Files should work wherever user places the application
- **Portability**: Application should work from any directory location

### JSON File Handling
**Files to Handle**:
- `data/constants.json` - Game balance parameters
- `data/actions.json` - Available game actions
- `data/events.json` - Game events and triggers
- `data/locations.json` - Game locations and properties

**Access Pattern**:
- **Reading**: Load on application startup and as needed
- **Writing**: Save changes immediately or on user action
- **Sharing**: Users copy entire JSON files to share configurations

### Data Consistency Requirements
- **No data loss**: Changes must be reliably persisted
- **Immediate updates**: Users must see correct information after changes
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of file read/write errors
- **Backup consideration**: Consider backup mechanisms for important data

## User Interface Requirements

### Current Interface Elements
- **Timeline Interface**: Drag-and-drop action sequence creation
- **Simulation Results**: Display simulation output and analysis
- **Three-panel layout**: Actions list, timeline, results (existing design)

### Planned Interface Additions
- **Parameter Editing UI**: Built-in controls for modifying JSON data
- **Graph Display**: Show simulation results graphically
- **Baseline Comparison**: Save and compare baseline graphs
- **Configuration Management**: Easy loading/saving of different setups

### Interface Technology
- **Current**: Vanilla JavaScript with HTML/CSS
- **Compatibility**: Should work within desktop app framework
- **Responsive**: Interface should work well in desktop window

## Performance Requirements

### Scale Considerations
- **User Base**: Maximum 10-20 total users
- **Data Size**: Small JSON files (~1-50KB each)
- **Usage Pattern**: Single-user local application
- **Network**: No network requirements (fully local)

### Performance Expectations
- **Startup Time**: Fast application launch
- **File Operations**: Quick JSON file read/write
- **Simulation**: Real-time or near-real-time simulation results
- **UI Responsiveness**: Smooth drag-and-drop and interface interactions

## Distribution Requirements

### Packaging
- **Single Executable**: One file to launch the application
- **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies for end users
- **Portable**: Application works from any location
- **JSON Files**: External data files alongside executable

### Installation
- **Zero Installation**: Just copy files and run
- **No Dependencies**: No Node.js, Python, or other runtime requirements for users
- **Windows Compatible**: Works on typical Windows systems
- **Minimal Setup**: Users should be able to run immediately

## Development Constraints

### Current Codebase Compatibility
- **Preserve Logic**: Keep existing simulation and game logic
- **UI Migration**: Adapt current web UI to desktop framework
- **Data Migration**: Convert current JSON handling to file system access

### No Constraints
- **Technology Stack**: Open to any approach that works
- **Budget**: No budget limitations (prefer free/open-source but not required)
- **Timeline**: No time pressure (can take time to do it right)
- **Complexity**: Willing to implement complex solutions if they provide benefits

## Integration Requirements

### Custom UI Integration
- **Built-in Editing**: Parameter editing interface integrated into main application
- **Data Binding**: UI changes should directly update JSON files
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes should be reflected immediately in simulation
- **Validation**: Input validation to prevent invalid configurations

### Future Feature Support
- **Graph Generation**: Support for baseline and comparison graphs
- **Save/Load**: Configuration management and sharing features
- **Extensibility**: Architecture should support future feature additions
