# Sessions 2025-06-22 to 2025-06-24: Vitals Graph Development & Capacity System

## Session Overview
Multi-day development of vitals graph system from initial bugs through complete rework to capacity integration.

## Session 2025-06-22: Initial Bug Fixes
### Critical Issues Resolved
1. **JavaScript Syntax Error**: Orphaned closing brace in index.html preventing page load
2. **Button Functionality**: toggleVitalsGraph() not being called
3. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Engine returns nested vitals, frontend expected flat
4. **DOM Detachment**: Graph element becoming detached with zero dimensions
5. **CSS Conflicts**: Positioning conflicts affecting layout

### User Feedback
- "Okay, it now appears" - confirmed graph working
- User requested cleanup of debugging code in follow-up

## Session 2025-06-22: Complete Vitals Graph Rework
### Intent Change
**Target Audience**: Game developers and expert speedrunners
**Scale Requirements**: Vitals max ~15 (not 100), decimal precision, 30+ minute timelines

### Major Replacement
1. **HTML Structure**: Replaced horizontal lines+markers with SVG-based chart
2. **CSS Rewrite**: Increased height to 200px, SVG-specific styling
3. **Visualization Engine**: Complete rewrite using SVG path elements
4. **Connected Lines**: SVG paths with M/L commands for accurate rendering
5. **Interactive Tooltips**: Mousemove tracking with closest point detection

### Technical Implementation
- **Scale System**: Y-axis 0-15 (every 5 units), X-axis time-based (every 5 minutes)
- **Grid System**: Dynamic grid lines and labels based on timeline duration
- **Data Accuracy**: Every second mathematically accurate
- **Tooltip Content**: Time, air/water/food values, location, inventory

## Session 2025-06-23: Scaling & Configuration Improvements
### Dynamic Scaling Enhancements
1. **Dynamic Maximum**: Chart scales to actual vital peaks instead of fixed 15
2. **Full-Width Utilization**: Short simulations span entire chart width
3. **Adaptive Time Intervals**: 30s/1m/5m/10m based on cycle duration
4. **Configurable Y-Axis**: Centralized config object for interval customization

### Configuration Architecture
- Added `vitalsGraphConfig` object for centralized settings
- No fallbacks during development to catch issues visibly
- Future-ready for step vs connected chart options

## Session 2025-06-24: Capacity System Implementation
### Game Mechanic Understanding
Vitals are capped at capacity limits (e.g., 18 air + 5 item with 20 capacity = 20 air, not 23)

### Implementation Details
1. **Game State Enhancement**: Added airCapacity, waterCapacity, foodCapacity fields
2. **Data Structure**: Enhanced simulation to track both vitals AND capacities
3. **Chart Scaling Revolution**: Uses capacity maximums instead of vital maximums
4. **Starting Values**: Changed from 100 to 10 for realistic scale
5. **Vital Bars Fix**: Updated right panel to show "current/capacity" format with proper scaling

### Technical Changes
- **Chart Scaling**: `Math.max(...capacities)` instead of `Math.max(...vitals)`
- **Minimum Logic**: Grid rounding that always includes 0 reference
- **Display Format**: "Air: 10/10" instead of "Air: 100%"
- **Bar Scaling**: `(current/capacity) * 100%` instead of `current%`

## User Interaction Patterns
- User provides clear problem descriptions
- Appreciates explanation of technical approaches
- Tests thoroughly and provides specific feedback
- Prefers realistic game-scale values over placeholder values
- Values both visual accuracy and information density

## Key Technical Insights
- DOM manipulation in timeline rendering affects child elements
- SVG provides better control for data visualization than HTML/CSS
- Capacity system fundamentally changes how charts should scale
- Configuration objects better than hardcoded values for development
- Fallback logic needed for data structure transitions

## Files Modified Across Sessions
- `public/index.html` (graph structure, syntax fixes)
- `public/css/styles.css` (SVG styling, positioning)
- `public/js/app.js` (complete visualization rewrite, capacity integration)
- `src/predictor_engine.js` (capacity data structure)
