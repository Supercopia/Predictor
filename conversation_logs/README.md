# Conversation Logs

This directory contains context from previous Claude Code sessions to help new sessions quickly understand:

- What problems were being solved
- How decisions were made
- User feedback and preferences
- Session-specific context that's not captured in code comments

## Usage Notes

For new sessions:
1. Start with the most recent session file for immediate context
2. Review topic-specific files for deep understanding of particular systems
3. Cross-reference with `docs/progress.md` and `docs/code_progress.md` for technical details

## Context Preservation

These logs capture the "why" and "how" of development decisions that aren't always obvious from code alone.
