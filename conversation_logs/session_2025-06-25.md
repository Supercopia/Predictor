# Session 2025-06-25: Major Systems Implementation

## Session Type
Major feature implementation session

## User's Request
Implementation of three major game systems:
1. Area Resources (location-based resources consumed before personal vitals)
2. Events (timer-based information tracking)
3. Learning/Familiarity System (action completion tracking with speed bonuses)

## Implementation Approach
User requested explicit plan confirmation before implementation of each system.

## Systems Implemented

### Area Resources System
**Game Mechanic**: Location-based air/water/food/power consumed before personal vitals
**Key Features**:
- Consumption priority: area resources first, then personal vitals
- Generation system with rate-based replenishment
- Loop reset mechanics (everything resets except artifacts)
- Location data restructure to object-based format

**Data Changes**:
- `data/locations.json` restructured from simple array to objects with resource data
- Talos: 50 air capacity with +0.2/s generation
- Laurion: 30 air, 25 power (no generation)
- Santorini: unlimited power generation

### Events System  
**Game Mechanic**: Timer-based event tracking and processing
**Key Features**:
- Timer-based event triggers
- Event effects (startResourceDrain, stopAreaGeneration)
- Status tracking for active events

**Initial Events**:
- "Hunger Starts" at 60s (begins food consumption)
- "Carbon Filters Fail" at 120s (stops Talos air generation)

### Learning/Familiarity System
**Game Mechanic**: Action completion tracking with speed bonuses
**Key Features**:
- Completion-based speed bonuses (fast: +0.1x, slow: +0.01x per completion)
- First completion universal +0.2x additional bonus
- Linear progression to 3x speed, then diminishing returns
- CSV import for learning data

**Action Classifications**:
- Fast learning: Travel actions, Cross Desert, Climb Mountain
- Slow learning: Take Food Ration, Take Water Bottle
- Wait action bypasses learning entirely

## Frontend Integration
- Added area resources display panel in right sidebar
- CSV import interface with file input and processing
- Enhanced timeline item display with learning data
- Module loading with ES6 imports and error handling

## Server Configuration
Added explicit module serving routes for new systems:
- `/src/area_resources.js`
- `/src/events.js`
- `/src/familiarity.js`
- `/src/csv_parser.js`

## User Feedback Pattern
- User provided explicit plan approval before implementation
- Iterative feedback during development
- Final confirmation that area resources were working correctly

## Testing Status
Area resources confirmed working by user at end of session.

## Files Created/Modified
**New Files**:
- `src/area_resources.js`
- `src/events.js` 
- `src/familiarity.js`
- `src/csv_parser.js`
- `data/events.json`

**Modified Files**:
- `data/locations.json` (complete restructure)
- `data/actions.json` (added learningType fields)
- `src/predictor_engine.js` (system integration)
- `public/js/app.js` (frontend integration)
- `public/index.html` (area resources panel)
- `public/css/styles.css` (styling)
- `server.js` (module routes)
