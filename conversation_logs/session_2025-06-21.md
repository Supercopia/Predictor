# Session 2025-06-21: Stability Improvements & UI Enhancements

## Session Context
Major stability and usability improvements session (retroactively documented due to power outage during original session).

## Critical Issues Addressed

### Module Loading & Caching Problems
**Issues**:
- ES module loading failures in browser environments
- Service worker interference with fetch requests
- Infinite reload loops from diagnostics script
- Cache-related loading issues

**Solutions**:
- Added cache-busting timestamps to script URLs
- Disabled service worker registration (commented out)
- Disabled diagnostics script to prevent reload loops
- Implemented multiple retry paths for data loading
- Created `fixed-app.js` as non-ES module fallback

### Frontend Engine Robustness
**Enhancements**:
- Modified predictor_engine.js for dynamic location loading from API
- Added fallback location system if locations.json fails
- Enhanced actions.js with comprehensive error handling
- Implemented timeout mechanisms to prevent hanging requests
- Added user-friendly error messages and recovery options

## Major UI Enhancements

### Timeline Multiplier Control System
**Features Added**:
- Step controls (increase/decrease buttons) in timeline footer
- Multiplier input field for batch action count modifications
- Global step size control for consistent count adjustments
- Action controls on each timeline item (increase/decrease/remove)
- Count display showing "Action x3" format
- Disabled action states with strikethrough text and opacity changes

### Visual Improvements
**Enhancements**:
- Restructured timeline items with flex layout
- Added location requirement indicators vs destination displays
- Enhanced action content layout with proper spacing
- Improved drag-drop visual feedback and interaction

### Custom Scrollbar Implementation
**Features**:
- Always-visible vertical scrollbar to timeline container
- Webkit scrollbar theming matching project colors
- Enhanced scrolling behavior and visual consistency
- Fixed scrolling issues with proper container sizing

## Architecture Improvements

### Error Handling & Reliability
**Implemented**:
- Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for all data loading
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Multiple API endpoint attempts for data fetching
- Fallback data structures for offline/error scenarios

### Performance Optimizations
**Added**:
- Cache-busting for all dynamic content requests
- Optimized loading strategies
- Better resource management

## Impact Assessment
**Before**: Non-functional app with loading issues
**After**: Stable, feature-rich interface with robust error handling

## User Experience Focus
- Enhanced timeline interaction capabilities
- Improved visual feedback and consistency
- Better error recovery and user guidance
- More intuitive action management controls

## Files Affected
- `public/index.html` (cache-busting, disabled features)
- `public/css/styles.css` (scrollbar, timeline controls)
- `public/js/app.js` (multiplier system, enhanced controls)
- `public/src/predictor_engine.js` (dynamic location loading)
- `public/src/actions.js` (retry mechanisms, error handling)
- `public/js/fixed-app.js` (new - fallback version)

## Documentation Note
Changes were unlogged during original session due to power outage, retroactively documented based on code analysis and git changes.
