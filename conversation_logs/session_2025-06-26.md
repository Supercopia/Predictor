# Session 2025-06-26: Area Resources & Events System Bug Fixes

## Session Type
Bug fix session - fixing issues from previous major implementation

## Context from Previous Session
Major systems were implemented in 2025-06-25 but had data flow and calculation issues.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Area Resources Display Issue
**Problem**: "No area resources available" after running simulations
**Root Cause**: `runSimulation()` wasn't copying `areaResources` and `events` data from engine to simulationHistory
**Fix**: Added missing data flow in lines 1201-1202
**User Feedback**: Confirmed area resources now display correctly

### 2. Familiarity System Bonus Calculation
**Problem**: First completion giving incorrect +0.1x universal bonus instead of +0.2x additional
**Root Cause**: Misunderstanding of bonus calculation mechanics
**Fix**: Updated `calculateSpeedMultiplier()` to use `1.0 + learningRate + 0.2` for first completion
**Impact**: 
- Fast actions: 1.3x speed multiplier
- Slow actions: 1.21x speed multiplier

### 3. Vitals Display Capacity Values
**Problem**: Vitals panel showing "X/undefined" instead of "X/10"
**Root Cause**: gameState replacement after simulation didn't preserve capacity fields
**Fix**: Added capacity preservation logic (lines 1216-1218)
**Result**: Vitals now show proper "current/capacity" format

## User Testing Approach
- User ran comprehensive tests of all systems
- Jest test suite: 14/14 tests passing
- Manual verification of each system integration
- Confirmed all fixes working together

## Key Insights for Future Sessions
- User does thorough testing after implementations
- Data flow between engine and frontend needs careful attention
- Game mechanics calculations must match user's understanding
- Integration testing reveals issues not caught in individual components

## Systems Status After Session
- Area Resources: Fully functional with location-based consumption
- Events: Timer-based events triggering correctly  
- Learning/Familiarity: Correct speed calculations
- Vitals Graph: Working with all systems integrated
- Capacity System: Chart scaling and display working

## Files Modified
- `public/js/app.js` (data flow and capacity preservation)
- `src/familiarity.js` (bonus calculation correction)
