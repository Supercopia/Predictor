# Predictor - Code Analysis

## Architecture Overview

The Predictor application is a time-loop game planner with the following key components:

1. **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**
   - `index.html`: Main application UI with three-panel layout
   - `public/js/app.js`: Core application logic and UI interactions
   - `public/css/styles.css`: Styling for the application

2. **Core Engine**
   - `public/src/predictor_engine.js`: Game state evaluation and simulation
   - `public/src/actions.js`: Action loading and management
   - `public/data/actions.json`: Action definitions
   - `public/data/locations.json`: Location definitions

3. **Server**
   - `server.js`: Express.js server with CORS and static file serving

4. **Testing & Development**
   - Test files in `/tests/`
   - Documentation in `/docs/`

## Key Components

### 1. Server (server.js)
- Express.js server running on port 3000
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Serves static files from `/public`
- Includes debug middleware for request logging
- Implements cache control headers

### 2. Core Application (app.js)
- Implements drag-and-drop timeline interface
- Manages game state and UI updates
- Handles action execution and simulation
- Implements vitals tracking and visualization
- Manages inventory system

### 3. Game Engine (predictor_engine.js)
- Evaluates action sequences
- Tracks game state (vitals, inventory, location)
- Implements game mechanics (vital drain, item consumption)
- Handles action validation and execution

### 4. Actions System (actions.js)
- Loads and manages game actions
- Handles multiple fallback paths for action definitions
- Provides action validation and lookup

## Key Features

1. **Time-Loop Simulation**
   - Tracks vitals (air, water, food) over time
   - Simulates action sequences
   - Visualizes resource depletion

2. **Action System**
   - Drag-and-drop action sequencing
   - Action validation based on location and inventory
   - Visual feedback for action outcomes

3. **UI/UX**
   - Three-panel layout (actions, timeline, game state)
   - Interactive vitals visualization
   - Responsive design
   - Action details modal

## Potential Issues and Recommendations

1. **Module Loading**
   - Multiple fallback paths indicate potential path resolution issues
   - Consider using a module bundler (like webpack or Vite) for more reliable imports

2. **Error Handling**
   - Some error handling could be more robust, especially in async operations
   - Add input validation for action parameters

3. **Performance**
   - Large action sequences might impact performance
   - Consider implementing virtualization for long timelines

4. **Testing**
   - Add more unit tests for core game mechanics
   - Implement end-to-end testing for critical user flows

5. **Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments for better code documentation
   - Document the action and location JSON schemas

## Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements
- Resolve module loading issues
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement input validation

### Future Enhancements
- Add save/load functionality
- Implement action categories and filtering
- Add more detailed action tooltips
- Implement undo/redo functionality

### Testing
- Add unit tests for core game logic
- Implement integration tests
- Add UI component tests

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Organization**
   - Some files are getting large (e.g., app.js) and could be split into smaller modules
   - Consider separating concerns more clearly (e.g., UI, state management, game logic)

2. **Dependencies**
   - Currently using vanilla JavaScript with no build step
   - Consider adding a build system for better dependency management and code splitting

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Ensure consistent behavior across different browsers
   - Consider adding polyfills if needed for older browsers

## Performance Considerations

1. **Rendering**
   - Timeline rendering could be optimized for large action sequences
   - Consider using a virtualized list for the timeline

2. **State Management**
   - Current state management could be made more robust
   - Consider using a state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand) for complex state

3. **Asset Loading**
   - Consider lazy loading non-critical assets
   - Optimize images and other static assets

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**
   - Add validation for all user inputs
   - Sanitize any dynamic content

2. **API Security**
   - Ensure all API endpoints have proper authentication/authorization
   - Implement rate limiting where appropriate

3. **Data Validation**
   - Validate all data from external sources
   - Use JSON Schema for validating action and location data
