## Overview
This document captures the interface requirements for the Predictor tool, as discussed with the development team.

## Core Interface Requirements

### 1. Layout
- [ ] Single-page application
- [ ] Three main panels:
  - Action selection panel (left)
  - Timeline visualization (center)
  - Game state details (right)

### 2. Key Components
- [ ] Timeline visualization with:
  - [ ] Color-coded vitals (Air, Water, Food)
  - [ ] Hoverable inventory tooltips
  - [ ] Visual indicators for location changes
  - [ ] Clear loop failure points

### 3. User Interactions
- [ ] Drag-and-drop action sequencing
- [ ] Click-to-select actions
- [ ] Undo/Redo functionality
- [ ] Action validation feedback

### 4. Visual Design
- [ ] Color scheme: Dark theme with high contrast for readability
- [ ] Responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] Clear typography and iconography

### 5. Technical Requirements
- [ ] Web-based interface
- [ ] Modern browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Framework: [To be determined]

## Open Questions
1. ✅ Should the interface support saving/loading action sequences?
   - **Answer:** Yes, with support for:
     - Pasting in a list of actions
     - Importing/exporting from files
     - Local storage for quick access to recent/favorite sequences
2. ✅ Are there specific accessibility requirements?
   - **Answer:** Initial considerations:
     - Gold/purple color palette for colorblind compatibility
     - Color contrast will be verified against WCAG standards
     - Future consideration: Full accessibility review and screen reader support
3. ✅ Should there be a tutorial or guided onboarding?
   - **Answer:** Yes, but details to be determined after initial implementation
   - Key features to cover: TBD
   - Format: TBD
4. ✅ What analytics or metrics should be displayed?
   - **Answer:** 
     - Core metrics will be the primary focus
     - No real-time updates needed (calculations are immediate)
     - Display will be optimized for minimal processing time
     - Specific metrics TBD based on actual usage patterns

## Decisions Made

### 1. Technical Stack: Vanilla JavaScript
- **Decision:** Use vanilla JavaScript with template literals for the interface
- **Rationale:**
  - No build step or complex tooling required
  - Minimal overhead for a primarily static interface
  - Direct DOM manipulation is sufficient for our needs
  - Easy to understand and maintain
- **Review Plan:**
  - After implementing core functionality, evaluate:
    1. Performance with large action sequences
    2. Code maintainability as features are added
    3. Developer experience for future contributors
  - Consider migrating to a framework if:
    - The component hierarchy becomes complex
    - State management becomes unwieldy
    - Team size increases significantly

## Next Steps
1. Review and finalize requirements
2. Create wireframes/mockups
3. Implement core UI components
4. Connect to game engine
5. User testing and iteration
