## [2025-06-28] (Session - Vitals Graph Button State & Positioning Fix)
- 👨‍💻 Author: Claude Code
- 🔄 Type: Bug Fix & Positioning Improvement
- ✅ Approved by: User (confirmed fix working)
- 🕒 Timestamp: 2025-06-28T11:00:00+00:00
- 📄 Files:
  - public/index.html (modified - HTML structure change)
  - public/js/app.js (modified - DOM re-attachment removal)
  - public/css/styles.css (modified - positioning constraints)
- ✨ Tested: Yes (User confirmed graph positioning fixed)
- 🎯 Impact: Vitals graph button state now syncs correctly and graph stays within timeline bounds
- 🏷️ Tags: bug-fix, vitals-graph, button-state, css-positioning, dom-structure

### Vitals Graph Button State Synchronization Fix
1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Issue: When vitals graph was visible and user added actions, graph would hide but button wouldn't update to "Show Vitals Graph"
   - Investigation: Found that `renderTimeline()` function uses `timelineEl.innerHTML = ''` which destroys all child elements
   - Discovery: Vitals graph was a child of timeline container, so it got destroyed and re-rendered with default `style="display: none;"`
   - Problem: Button state variable `isGraphVisible` and button text weren't updated when graph was destroyed

2. **Structural Solution**:
   - **HTML Change**: Moved vitals graph from inside `<div class="timeline">` to be a sibling element in `<main class="timeline-container">`
   - **Before**: `<div class="timeline"><div id="vitals-graph">...</div></div>`
   - **After**: `<div class="timeline">...</div><div id="vitals-graph">...</div>`
   - **Impact**: Graph element no longer gets destroyed during timeline re-rendering

3. **JavaScript Cleanup**:
   - **Removed**: DOM re-attachment logic from `toggleVitalsGraph()` function (lines 1082-1088)
   - **Previous Code**: 
     ```javascript
     if (!vitalsGraphEl.parentElement) {
         const timelineEl = document.getElementById('timeline');
         if (timelineEl) {
             timelineEl.appendChild(vitalsGraphEl);
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Rationale**: No longer needed since graph element won't be destroyed

### Vitals Graph Positioning Constraint Fix
1. **Positioning Issue**:
   - Problem: After structural move, graph extended to full viewport width past timeline boundaries
   - Initial Fix: Changed CSS from `left: 0; right: 0; width: 100%;` to `left: 1rem; right: 1rem;`
   - Additional Issue: Graph was still positioned relative to viewport, not timeline container

2. **CSS Positioning Solution**:
   - **Container Fix**: Added `position: relative;` to `.timeline-container` class
   - **Graph Constraints**: Updated `.vitals-graph` positioning:
     ```css
     .vitals-graph {
         position: absolute;
         top: 80px;  /* Position below timeline header and buttons */
         left: 1rem;
         right: 1rem;
         height: 200px;
         /* ... other properties ... */
     }
     ```
   - **Impact**: Graph now positions relative to timeline-container instead of viewport, constrained within timeline boundaries

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - **Positioning Context**: Timeline-container now establishes positioning context for absolutely positioned children
   - **Margin Consistency**: 1rem margins match existing padding used throughout application
   - **Visual Result**: Graph properly contained within timeline area, no longer extending to screen edges

## [2025-06-26] (Session - Area Resources & Events System Bug Fixes)
- 👨‍💻 Author: Claude Code
- 🔄 Type: Bug Fixes & System Corrections
- ✅ Approved by: User (confirmed fixes working)
- 🕒 Timestamp: 2025-06-26T13:50:00+00:00
- 📄 Files:
  - public/js/app.js (modified - data flow and capacity preservation)
  - src/familiarity.js (modified - first completion bonus calculation)
- ✨ Tested: Yes (User confirmed all fixes working)
- 🎯 Impact: All core systems now display and calculate correctly
- 🏷️ Tags: bug-fixes, data-flow, familiarity-system, vitals-display

### Area Resources Data Flow Fix
1. **Issue**: Area resources display showed "No area resources available" after running simulations
2. **Root Cause**: `runSimulation()` function wasn't copying `areaResources` and `events` data from predictor engine timeline to simulationHistory
3. **Fix**: Added `areaResources: state.areaResources, events: state.events` to simulationHistory entries (lines 1201-1202)
4. **Impact**: Area resources now display correctly showing location-based resources and their current values

### Familiarity System First Completion Bonus Correction
1. **Issue**: First completion was giving incorrect +0.1x universal bonus instead of normal rate + 0.2x additional
2. **Root Cause**: Misunderstanding of bonus calculation - should be learning rate + additional 0.2x
3. **Fix**: Updated `calculateSpeedMultiplier()` function (lines 14-20):
   - Fast actions: +0.1x (normal) + 0.2x (additional) = 1.3x speed multiplier
   - Slow actions: +0.01x (normal) + 0.2x (additional) = 1.21x speed multiplier
4. **Code Change**: `return 1.0 + learningRate + 0.2;` for first completion
5. **Impact**: Learning progression now follows correct game mechanics

### Vitals Display Capacity Values Fix
1. **Issue**: Vitals panel showed "X/undefined" instead of "X/10" for capacity values
2. **Root Cause**: After simulation completion, gameState was replaced with new object that didn't include capacity fields
3. **Fix**: Updated gameState assignment to preserve capacity values (lines 1216-1218):
   ```javascript
   airCapacity: finalState.capacities ? finalState.capacities.airCapacity : gameState.airCapacity,
   waterCapacity: finalState.capacities ? finalState.capacities.waterCapacity : gameState.waterCapacity,
   foodCapacity: finalState.capacities ? finalState.capacities.foodCapacity : gameState.foodCapacity,
   ```
4. **Impact**: Vitals display now shows proper "current/capacity" format consistently

### Area Resources System Implementation
1. **Core Module**: Created `src/area_resources.js` with AreaResources class
   - Location-based resource management (air, water, food, power)
   - Consumption priority: area resources consumed before personal vitals
   - Generation system with rate-based replenishment
   - Loop reset mechanics (everything resets except artifacts)

2. **Location Data**: Completely restructured `data/locations.json`:
   - Changed from simple string array to object-based structure with area resource data
   - Talos: 50 air capacity with +0.2/s generation
   - Laurion: 30 air, 25 power (no generation)
   - Santorini: unlimited power generation (initial: -1 indicates unlimited)

3. **Integration**: Modified predictor engine to:
   - Initialize area resources at simulation start
   - Apply area resource consumption before personal vitals drain
   - Include area resource data in timeline entries
   - Process generation during action execution

### Events System Implementation  
1. **Core Module**: Created `src/events.js` with Events class
   - Timer-based event tracking and processing
   - Event effects system (startResourceDrain, stopAreaGeneration)
   - Status tracking for active events

2. **Events Data**: Created `data/events.json` with initial events:
   - "Hunger Starts" at 60s (begins food consumption)
   - "Carbon Filters Fail" at 120s (stops Talos air generation)

3. **Integration**: Enhanced predictor engine to:
   - Process events at each simulation step
   - Apply event effects to game state and area resources
   - Include event status in timeline data

### Learning/Familiarity System Implementation
1. **Core Module**: Created `src/familiarity.js` with learning calculations:
   - Completion-based speed bonuses (fast: +0.1x, slow: +0.01x per completion)
   - First completion universal +0.2x additional bonus
   - Linear progression to 3x speed, then diminishing returns
   - Time-based partial completion support

2. **CSV Parser**: Created `src/csv_parser.js` for learning data import:
   - Parses CSV files with action names and completion data
   - Supports both completion count and time-based learning
   - Validation against actions database

3. **Actions Data**: Enhanced `data/actions.json` with learning type classifications:
   - Added `learningType` field to all actions
   - Fast learning: Travel actions (Travel to Laurion, Canyon, Volcano), Cross Desert, Climb Mountain
   - Slow learning: Take Food Ration, Take Water Bottle
   - Wait action bypasses learning system entirely

4. **Integration**: Enhanced predictor engine and frontend:
   - Learning state tracking throughout simulation
   - Action duration calculation with learning applied
   - CSV import interface in frontend
   - Learning data display in timeline

### Frontend Integration
1. **Area Resources Display**: Added complete panel in right sidebar:
   - Added area-resources-display section to public/index.html
   - Current resource levels by location with proper formatting
   - Generation rates display where applicable (+X.X/s)
   - Proper formatting for unlimited resources (∞/∞)

2. **CSV Import Interface**: Added file input and processing for learning data:
   - Added "Import Learning CSV" button and hidden file input to timeline controls
   - Automatic parsing and state initialization
   - Error handling for invalid CSV data

3. **Timeline UI Enhancements**: Enhanced timeline item display and controls:
   - Added action controls (increase/decrease/remove buttons) to each timeline item
   - Implemented flexible layout with action-content and action-controls sections
   - Added disabled states with strikethrough text and reduced opacity
   - Enhanced location requirement vs destination display formatting

4. **Module Loading**: Enhanced app.js with:
   - ES6 module imports for new systems
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Proper initialization order and dependencies

### Server Configuration
1. **Module Serving**: Added explicit routes in server.js:
   - `/src/area_resources.js` - Area resources module
   - `/src/events.js` - Events module  
   - `/src/familiarity.js` - Learning system
   - `/src/csv_parser.js` - CSV parser
   - Proper MIME type handling for JavaScript modules

     if (!vitalsGraphEl.parentElement) {
         const timelineEl = document.getElementById('timeline');
         if (timelineEl) {
             timelineEl.appendChild(vitalsGraphEl);
         }
     }
     ```

5. **CSS Positioning Conflicts**:

   - Updated to use consistent `top: 20px` positioning
   - Corrected width calculations for proper graph display

6. **Simulation History Integration**:
   - Fixed population of simulationHistory array with proper data structure
   - Ensured vitals data flows correctly from engine to graph visualization
   - Added proper empty state handling when no simulation data exists

## [2025-06-22] (Session Continuation - Complete Vitals Graph Rework)
- 👨‍💻 Author: Claude Code
- 🔄 Type: Complete Feature Rework
- ✅ Approved by: User (explicit plan confirmation)
- 🕒 Timestamp: 2025-06-22T19:00:00+00:00

- ✨ Tested: Yes (Server started successfully)
- 🎯 Impact: Complete replacement of vitals graph with connected line chart
- 🏷️ Tags: major-rewrite, data-visualization, svg, connected-lines, tooltip

### Complete Vitals Graph Replacement
**Intent Change**: Utility-focused visualization for game developers and expert speedrunners
**Scale Change**: Vitals max ~15 (not 100), decimal precision, 30+ minute timelines

1. **HTML Structure Replacement**:
   - Removed horizontal line + marker approach completely
   - Implemented SVG-based chart with proper namespace elements
   - Added grid background, axis groups, and tooltip elements
   - Structured for connected line chart rendering

2. **CSS Complete Rewrite**:
   - Increased graph height from 100px to 200px for better visibility
   - Implemented SVG-specific styling (.air-line, .water-line, .food-line)
   - Added axis styling (.axis-line, .axis-text, .grid-line)
   - Enhanced tooltip styling with proper positioning
   - Changed from pointer-events: none to auto for interaction

3. **JavaScript Visualization Engine Rewrite**:
   - **updateVitalsGraph()**: Complete rewrite using SVG path elements
   - **Scale System**: Y-axis 0-15 (every 5 units), X-axis time-based (every 5 minutes)
   - **Connected Lines**: SVG paths with M/L commands for accurate line rendering
   - **Grid System**: Dynamic grid lines and labels based on timeline duration
   - **setupVitalsTooltip()**: New function with mousemove tracking and closest point detection

4. **Tooltip Implementation**:
   - Interactive overlay rect for mouse tracking
   - Real-time tooltip showing: time, air/water/food values, location, inventory
   - Smart positioning to keep tooltip in bounds
   - Multi-line SVG text with proper spacing

5. **Data Accuracy**:
   - Every second mathematically accurate (no visual second markers needed)
   - Proper scaling for 30+ minute timelines
   - Decimal precision maintained (vitals displayed as X.X format)
   - Connected lines represent gradual changes during action execution

### Future Tasks Added to TODO
- Horizontal zoom functionality for detailed time section analysis
- Tooltip approach revision for better state information display  
- Scale customization controls (finer than every 5 units)
- Config option to switch between connected lines and step chart

## [2025-06-23] (Session Continuation - Graph Scaling & Configuration Improvements)
- 👨‍💻 Author: Claude Code
- 🔄 Type: Feature Enhancements
- ✅ Approved by: User (iterative improvements)
- 🕒 Timestamp: 2025-06-23T21:45:00+00:00
- 📄 Files:
  - public/js/app.js (modified - scaling and configuration improvements)
- ✨ Tested: No (server running, ready for testing)
- 🎯 Impact: Better graph utilization and configurable intervals
- 🏷️ Tags: scaling, configuration, adaptive-intervals, full-width

### Graph Scaling & Configuration Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Maximum Scaling**:
   - **Issue**: Chart was capped at fixed maximum of 15, wasting space for lower values
   - **Solution**: `const maxVital = Math.max(...simulationHistory.map(d => Math.max(d.air, d.water, d.food)))`
   - **Impact**: Chart now scales to actual maximum vital value achieved in cycle

2. **Configurable Y-Axis Intervals**:
   - **Issue**: Hardcoded 5-unit grid intervals
   - **Solution**: Added `vitalsGraphConfig` object with `yAxisInterval` property
   - **Implementation**: `const yStep = vitalsGraphConfig.yAxisInterval;` (no fallback during development)
   - **Impact**: Grid density now configurable for different analysis needs

3. **Full-Width Graph Utilization**:
   - **Issue**: Short simulations (e.g., 30 seconds) only used small portion of chart width
   - **Solution**: Removed minimum time constraint: `const maxTime = gameState.timeElapsed;`
   - **Impact**: Graph always spans full width regardless of simulation duration

4. **Adaptive Time Grid Intervals**:
   - **Issue**: Fixed 5-minute intervals inappropriate for all cycle lengths
   - **Solution**: Dynamic interval selection based on total duration:
     - ≤2 minutes: 30-second intervals
     - ≤10 minutes: 1-minute intervals  
     - ≤30 minutes: 5-minute intervals
     - >30 minutes: 10-minute intervals
   - **Labels**: Seconds format for short cycles, minutes for longer ones
   - **End Marker**: Always shows grid line at actual end time

5. **Configuration Architecture**:
   - **Added**: `vitalsGraphConfig` object for centralized settings
   - **Properties**: `yAxisInterval` (current), `chartType` (future step vs connected)
   - **Philosophy**: No fallbacks during development to catch issues visibly

6. **Tooltip Coordinate Updates**:
   - **Fix**: Updated tooltip time calculation to use dynamic `maxTime`
   - **Parameters**: Added `maxTime` parameter to `setupVitalsTooltip()` function

## [2025-06-24] (Session Continuation - Capacity System Implementation)
- 👨‍💻 Author: Claude Code
- 🔄 Type: Major Feature Implementation
- ✅ Approved by: User (explicit plan confirmation)
- 🕒 Timestamp: 2025-06-24T18:15:00+00:00
- 📄 Files:
  - public/js/app.js (modified - capacity tracking and chart scaling)
  - public/src/predictor_engine.js (modified - capacity data structure)
- ✨ Tested: Partial (syntax error fixed, ready for full testing)
- 🎯 Impact: Chart now scales to actual capacity limits, not just vital values
- 🏷️ Tags: capacity-system, chart-scaling, game-mechanics, data-structure

### Complete Capacity System Implementation

**Game Mechanic Understanding**: Vitals are capped at capacity limits (e.g., 18 air + 5 item with 20 capacity = 20 air, not 23)

1. **Capacity Fields Added to Game State**:
   - **gameState**: Added `airCapacity: 100, waterCapacity: 100, foodCapacity: 100`
   - **predictor_engine.js**: Added capacity fields to initial state object
   - **resetGameState()**: Included capacity fields in state reset function
   - **Default Values**: All capacities start at 100 (matching current behavior)

2. **Enhanced Simulation Data Structure**:
   - **Timeline Data**: Added `capacities` object alongside existing `vitals` object
   - **Data Format**: `{capacities: {airCapacity, waterCapacity, foodCapacity}}`
   - **simulationHistory**: Added capacity tracking with fallback logic
   - **Initial State**: Capacity values included in simulation history from start

3. **Chart Scaling Revolution**:
   - **Previous**: `Math.max(...simulationHistory.map(d => Math.max(d.air, d.water, d.food)))`
   - **New Maximum**: `Math.max(...simulationHistory.map(d => Math.max(d.airCapacity, d.waterCapacity, d.foodCapacity)))`
   - **Minimum Logic**: `Math.min(0, Math.floor(actualMin / yStep) * yStep)` - rounded to grid, always includes 0
   - **Impact**: Chart shows actual capacity ceiling, not just current vital ranges

4. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - **Syntax Error Fix**: Removed duplicate `const yStep` declaration (lines 601 & 609)
   - **Comment Organization**: Moved "Configurable step size" to declaration point
   - **Variable Scope**: Proper yStep usage throughout grid generation
   - **Documentation**: Clear comments about configurable intervals

5. **Configuration Architecture**:
   - **Maintained**: `vitalsGraphConfig.yAxisInterval` for grid customization
   - **Development Philosophy**: No fallbacks to catch issues visibly
   - **Future Ready**: Structure supports capacity-setting actions

### Technical Implementation Details

**Data Flow**:
1. Actions modify state.airCapacity/waterCapacity/foodCapacity
2. Predictor engine includes capacities in timeline data
3. Frontend collects capacity values in simulationHistory
4. Chart scales to capacity maximums, not vital value maximums

**Fallback Logic**:
```javascript
airCapacity: state.capacities ? state.capacities.airCapacity : state.airCapacity
```
Handles both nested and flat data structures during transition.

## [2025-06-24] (Session Continuation - Starting Values Update & Configuration Planning)
- 👨‍💻 Author: Claude Code
- 🔄 Type: Configuration Changes
- ✅ Approved by: User (direct instruction)
- 🕒 Timestamp: 2025-06-24T18:45:00+00:00
- 📄 Files:
  - public/js/app.js (modified - starting values)
  - public/src/predictor_engine.js (modified - starting values)
- ✨ Tested: No (awaiting testing)
- 🎯 Impact: More realistic starting values for testing and development
- 🏷️ Tags: configuration, starting-values, game-balance

### Starting Values Configuration Update

1. **Starting Values Changed**:
   - **Previous**: All vitals and capacities started at 100
   - **New**: All vitals and capacities start at 10
   - **Locations Updated**:
     - `gameState` initial values: air, water, food, airCapacity, waterCapacity, foodCapacity = 10
     - `resetGameState()` function: all values = 10
     - `predictor_engine.js` state initialization: all values = 10

2. **Rationale**:
   - **Realistic Scale**: Starting value of 10 more appropriate for actual game mechanics
   - **Chart Scaling**: Better visual detail and scaling for typical vital ranges
   - **Development**: Easier to see capacity vs current vital differences

3. **Future Configuration Architecture**:
   - **TODO Added**: Create game configuration JSON file for starting values and constants
   - **TODO Added**: Replace hardcoded values with JSON-based configuration
   - **Philosophy**: Minimize code editing for game balance changes
   - **Scope**: Starting vitals, capacities, consumption rates, and other game constants

## [2025-06-24] (Session Continuation - Vital Bars Capacity Fix)
- 👨‍💻 Author: Claude Code
- 🔄 Type: Bug Fix & UI Enhancement
- ✅ Approved by: User (identified issue with vital bars)
- 🕒 Timestamp: 2025-06-24T19:00:00+00:00
- 📄 Files:
  - public/js/app.js (modified - updateGameStateDisplay function)
  - public/index.html (modified - vital display format)
- ✨ Tested: No (awaiting testing)
- 🎯 Impact: Vital bars now correctly scale to capacity instead of hardcoded 100
- 🏷️ Tags: vital-bars, capacity-scaling, ui-fix, display-format

### Vital Bars Capacity-Based Scaling Fix

**Issue Identified**: Vital bars in right panel were hardcoded to scale to 100, ignoring capacity system

1. **Display Format Update**:
   - **Previous**: "Air: 100%" (percentage format)
   - **New**: "Air: 10/10" (current/capacity format)
   - **Updated HTML**: Changed default display from "100%" to "10/10" for all vitals

2. **Bar Scaling Logic**:
   - **Previous**: `style.width = ${gameState.air}%` (assumed 100 max)
   - **New**: `style.width = ${(gameState.air / gameState.airCapacity) * 100}%`
   - **Result**: Bar width now properly reflects percentage of current capacity

3. **Enhanced Display Function**:
   - **updateGameStateDisplay()**: Updated to show current/capacity format
   - **Dynamic Scaling**: Bars adjust as capacity changes (e.g., 8/15 shows ~53% filled)
   - **Consistency**: All three vitals (air, water, food) follow same capacity-based logic

4. **UI Improvements**:
   - **Information Density**: Users now see both current value and capacity limit
   - **Visual Accuracy**: Bar fill percentage matches actual vital/capacity ratio
   - **Future Compatibility**: System automatically adapts when capacity-modifying actions are implemented
