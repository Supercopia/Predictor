# Historical Context

## Initial Development Phase

The Predictor project was initially developed with ChatGPT as the AI assistant. This phase has some important implications for the current codebase:

### File Format Migration
1. Original files were stored as RTF documents
2. Some files might still need conversion to proper source code format
3. File paths and references might reflect this transitional state

### Development Challenges
The initial development phase faced several challenges that explain some current architectural decisions:

1. **Testing Implementation**
   - Inconsistent test coverage
   - Mix of manual and automated testing
   - Need for systematic test strategy

2. **Database Integration**
   - Incomplete SQL database integration
   - Data storage primarily in JSON files
   - Future work needed for proper persistence

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Limited UI implementation
   - Focus on core engine functionality
   - UI plans documented but not implemented

4. **Documentation**
   - Some gaps in early documentation
   - Multiple documentation formats
   - Ongoing efforts to standardize

5. **Task Management**
   - Initial ad-hoc task tracking
   - Migration to systematic TODO list
   - Need for better progress tracking

## Impact on Current Development

These historical factors influence current development in several ways:

1. **Code Structure**
   - Some patterns reflect the initial development phase
   - Ongoing modularization efforts
   - Focus on maintainable architecture

2. **Documentation**
   - Multiple changelog formats
   - Detailed metadata requirements
   - Strict approval process

3. **Testing**
   - Push for comprehensive test coverage
   - Jest as standard testing framework
   - Both unit and integration tests

4. **Development Process**
   - Explicit approval required ("Yes, proceed")
   - Detailed change logging
   - Focus on maintainable patterns

## Moving Forward

Understanding this historical context helps in:
1. Making architectural decisions
2. Maintaining backward compatibility
3. Prioritizing technical debt
4. Planning future enhancements
