# Changelog / Progress Log

## Project Overview

### 🔄 Purpose
Build a predictor/analyzer tool for a text-based exploration game involving time loops.

### ✨ Function
Evaluate a full list of actions taken during a loop and return the game state after each one, as well as a final summary.

### 🔄 Tracked State
Air, water, food (vitals), inventory (quantities), location, loop number, time elapsed.

### 🎯 Goal
Provide players and developers with a dynamic and comprehensive view of the loop for optimization and balancing.

### 👤 Scope
Single-player only. No multiplayer features planned.

## Key Mechanics

### ⏲️ Vitals
Deplete at a rate of -0.1/s, plus optional extra consumption per action.

### 🎒 Inventory
Actions never give vitals directly — they provide inventory items (e.g., Water Bottle) which are auto-consumed when a vital drops below 0.

### 🔄 Actions
All actions have locationRequirements — some with multiple valid locations.

### 📦 Inventory System
Currently simple (quantity per item), but will be upgraded later to match the real game's complexity.

### ✅ Core Flow
Primary input is a list of actions; output is a timeline of state changes + final summary.

## Stack

### 🔧 Backend
Language: JavaScript (backend + core logic)

### 🎨 Frontend
- **Technical Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript with template literals
- **Core Components**:
  - Action selection panel (left)
  - Scrollable timeline visualization (center)
  - Game state details (right)
- **Features**:
  - Color-coded vitals (Air, Water, Food)
  - Hoverable inventory tooltips
  - Drag-and-drop action sequencing
  - Save/load action sequences
- **Design**:
  - Gold/purple color scheme for accessibility
  - Responsive layout
  - Dark theme with high contrast
