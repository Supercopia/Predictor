## [2025-06-28] Vitals Graph Button State & Positioning Fix
- **Session Type**: Bug fix and positioning improvement
- **Focus**: Fixed vitals graph button state synchronization and graph positioning constraints
- **Key Issues Resolved**:
  - Graph button state not updating when graph was hidden due to timeline re-rendering
  - Vitals graph extending past timeline boundaries to screen edges
- **Root Cause**: Timeline re-rendering with `innerHTML = ''` was destroying vitals graph child element
- **Solution**: Moved vitals graph outside timeline container as sibling element
- **Positioning Fix**: Added `position: relative` to timeline container and constrained graph with proper margins
- **Impact**: Button state now syncs correctly and graph stays within timeline bounds
- **Status**: Both issues fully resolved and tested

  - Corrected familiarity system first completion bonus from +0.1x to proper +0.2x additional bonus
  - Fixed vitals panel showing "X/undefined" instead of proper capacity values
- **Root Causes**: Data flow issues between simulation engine and frontend, incorrect bonus calculations
- **Impact**: All core systems now display and calculate correctly
- **Status**: Area resources, events, and familiarity systems fully functional

## [2025-06-25] Area Resources & Events System Implementation  
- **Session Type**: Major feature implementation
- **Focus**: Complete implementation of area resources and timer-based events systems
- **New Game Mechanics**:
  - Area resources: Location-based air/water/food/power that get consumed before personal vitals
  - Events: Timer-based information tracking (e.g., "Hunger Starts" at 60s, "Carbon Filters Fail" at 120s)
  - Learning/Familiarity: Action completion tracking with speed bonuses
- **Key Components**:
  - Created area resources module with consumption priority system
  - Implemented events system with timer triggers and instant effects
  - Added familiarity system with completion-based learning curves
  - Enhanced predictor engine to integrate all new systems
  - Updated frontend with area resources display panel
  - Added CSV import for learning data
- **Status**: Complete implementation with frontend integration and display

## [2025-06-22] Complete Vitals Graph Rework
- **Session Type**: Major feature replacement

- **Intent**: Utility-focused visualization for game developers and expert speedrunners
- **Key Changes**:
  - Replaced HTML structure with SVG-based chart system
  - Implemented connected line chart with proper scaling (vitals 0-15, not 100)
  - Added interactive tooltip showing vitals/inventory/location at any time point
  - Designed for 30+ minute timeline analysis with mathematical accuracy to every second
  - Enhanced visual patterns for expert users to develop intuition over numbers
- **Status**: Complete replacement functional, future enhancements planned (zoom, config options)

## [2025-06-23] Graph Scaling & Configuration Improvements
- **Session Type**: Feature enhancement continuation
- **Focus**: Improved graph scaling and configurable intervals for better utility
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Dynamic maximum scaling: chart now scales to actual vital peaks instead of fixed 15 cap
  - Full-width utilization: short simulations now span entire chart width
  - Adaptive time intervals: 30s/1m/5m/10m intervals based on cycle duration
  - Configurable Y-axis grid: centralized config object for interval customization
  - Development-focused: removed fallbacks to make issues visible during development
- **Status**: Ready for testing with various simulation lengths and vital ranges

## [2025-06-24] Capacity System Implementation
- **Session Type**: Major feature implementation
- **Focus**: Complete capacity tracking system for accurate chart scaling
- **Game Mechanic**: Vitals are capped at capacity limits (items can't exceed capacity)
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added capacity fields (airCapacity, waterCapacity, foodCapacity) to all game state objects
  - Enhanced simulation data to track both current vitals AND capacity limits
  - Revolutionized chart scaling: now uses capacity maximums instead of vital value maximums
  - Implemented proper minimum scaling with grid rounding that always includes 0 reference
  - Fixed syntax error from duplicate variable declarations
- **Impact**: Chart now shows the actual ceiling vitals can reach, enabling proper capacity-based planning
- **Status**: Implementation complete, syntax error resolved, ready for testing

## [2025-06-24] Starting Values & Configuration Planning
- **Session Type**: Configuration adjustment and future planning
- **Focus**: Realistic starting values and JSON-based configuration architecture
- **Changes**: 
  - Changed all starting vitals and capacities from 100 to 10
  - Updated gameState, resetGameState, and predictor engine initialization
- **Planning**: Added TODOs for JSON-based game configuration system
- **Rationale**: More realistic scale for development, better chart visualization, easier capacity vs vital distinction
- **Status**: Values updated, ready for testing with new scale

## [2025-06-24] Vital Bars Capacity Fix
- **Session Type**: Bug fix and UI enhancement
- **Focus**: Fixed vital bars to scale relative to capacity instead of hardcoded 100
- **Issue**: Right panel vital bars were showing percentages based on 100, ignoring capacity system
- **Changes**:
  - Updated display format from "Air: 100%" to "Air: 10/10" (current/capacity)
  - Fixed bar scaling logic to use (current/capacity) * 100% instead of current%
  - Enhanced information density showing both current and capacity values
- **Impact**: Vital bars now accurately reflect capacity-based game mechanics
- **Status**: Vital display system now fully integrated with capacity system

## [2025-06-22] Vitals Graph Implementation & Bug Fixes
- **Session Type**: Continuation from previous work
- **Focus**: Complete implementation and debugging of vitals graph functionality
- **Major Issues Resolved**:
  - JavaScript syntax error in index.html preventing page load
  - Button click events not triggering toggleVitalsGraph() function
  - Data structure mismatch between frontend and engine (nested vs flat vitals)
  - DOM element detachment causing invisible graph display
  - CSS positioning conflicts affecting graph layout
- **Result**: Vitals graph now fully functional and displaying simulation data correctly
- **User Confirmation**: "Okay, it now appears" - graph working as expected

## [2025-06-22] Code Cleanup & Maintenance  
- **Session Type**: Continuation from vitals graph work
- **Focus**: Cleanup of debugging code from vitals graph implementation
- **Changes**: Removed console.log statements and debugging artifacts while preserving functionality
- **Status**: Vitals graph working correctly, code cleaner and production-ready

## Project Overview

### 🔄 Purpose
Build a predictor/analyzer tool for a text-based exploration game involving time loops.

### ✨ Function
Evaluate a full list of actions taken during a loop and return the game state after each one, as well as a final summary.

### 🔄 Tracked State
Air, water, food (vitals), inventory (quantities), location, loop number, time elapsed.

### 🎯 Goal
Provide players and developers with a dynamic and comprehensive view of the loop for optimization and balancing.

### 👤 Scope
Single-player only. No multiplayer features planned.

## Key Mechanics

### ⏲️ Vitals
Deplete at a rate of -0.1/s, plus optional extra consumption per action.

### 🎒 Inventory
Actions never give vitals directly — they provide inventory items (e.g., Water Bottle) which are auto-consumed when a vital drops below 0.

### 🔄 Actions
All actions have locationRequirements — some with multiple valid locations.

### 📦 Inventory System
Currently simple (quantity per item), but will be upgraded later to match the real game's complexity.

### ✅ Core Flow
Primary input is a list of actions; output is a timeline of state changes + final summary.

## Stack
